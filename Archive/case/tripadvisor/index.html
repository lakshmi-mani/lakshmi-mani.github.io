          <div class="row">
            <h2>The App</h2>
            <p>Tripadvisor is a great app that has tons of reviews and information on restaurants and things to do around you. The app has traditionally had a focus on "pre booking", ie. planning and booking before a trip. </p>
            <p>However, the tons of information on the website will also make it an ideal app to help find local business around your current location! I find pain points in using Tripadvisor for this purpose.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="row">
            <h2>User Personas</h2>
            <p>Meet Troy! Troy is a young vibrant traveller to San Francisco who is hoping to find cool new things to do around him.</p>
            <div class="col-sm-12 imgbox"><img src="persona.jpg" />
              <p class="imgtag">Hello Troy, you dashing fella!</p>
            </div>            
          </div>

          <div class="row">
            <h2>Guerilla Usability Testing</h2>
            <p>I conducted my tests on 7 travellers staying in a hostel in San Francisco.   </p>

              <ol>
                <li>Task 1: Find a highly rated comedy club in San Francisco that is open tonight that you can attend.</li>
                <li>Task 2: Find the best Italian restaurant, within a medium price range that is closest to you.</li>
                <li>Task 3: Book a hotel room within a budget of $300 for this weekend, in the SoMa neighbourhood.</li>
              </ol>

            <p>I used neutral language and open ended scenarios in the tasks so as to avoid leading the users to solve them in a particular way.   </p>


        </div>

          <div class="row">
            <h2>Synthesis</h2>
            <p>I reviewed the videos I took, and identified what are the troubles users faced, when they had trouble, when they took a long time to figure stuff out etc.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-12 imgbox"><img src="Synthesis1.jpg" />
              <p class="imgtag">Grouping issues by similarity, and ordering them by the users themselves.</p>
            </div>            

            <p>As there were several issues that I found with the app, I decided to map it on a 2x2 of what are the issues that are important to the user vs important to the business. </p>
            <div class="col-sm-12 imgbox"><img src="Synthesis2.jpg" />
              <p class="imgtag">A mapping of the issues important to the user vs the business</p>
            </div>      
            <p>This clearly showed that trouble with search results and filtering was something that could be improved on to help both the company and the user experience.</p>
            
          </div>


          <div class="row">
            <h2>Design Story</h2>
            <p>Next, I decided to break down this feature idea to improve search and filtering into tiny little tasks to scope out the project for myself. This also meant that I wouldn't miss out any interactions. CRUD framework was really useful in helping with that.  </p>
            <p><b>EPIC:</b> Improve search and filtering </p>
            <p><b>USERS CAN:</b> </p>
            <ul>
              <li>search for phrases</li>
              <li>view suggestions when there are few search results</li>
              <li>view search suggestions for no results</li>
              <li>suggested phrases</li>
              <li>view a search result</li>
              <li>come back to search results</li>
              <li>filter search results by category, budget, location</li>
            </ul>
          </div>


          <div class="row">
            <h2>Task Flows</h2>
            <p>Then I visualized a typical path that the user will take through the app with my new feature.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-12 imgbox"><img src="taskflow.jpg" />
              <p class="imgtag">Task flow of a user using the new search and filtering feature</p>
            </div>            
          </div>
