              <p>I worked with one of our PMs, Emily in this phase. We talked to Stride users to understand their mental models on income, and why they weren't checking to see if they were eligible for subsidies.</p>

              <h5 class="title-quote">It's hard for SEs to estimate their income</h5>
              
              <p>SEs don't get a steady paycheck at the end of the month. Their income can be highly volatile, seasonal and comes from multiple sources that changes throughout the year. So it becomes difficult for them to predict   how much money they will be making for the year.  </p>

              <p>Majority of users assumed that subsidies were "like Medicare", and that they were only available for lower-income individuals. Users thought they made too much money, so never bothered checking.</p>
              <p>This findind was also backed by <a class="link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/08/why-americans-all-believe-they-are-middle-class/278240/">scientific evidence</a> that suggested that most Americans think they're middle class, regardless of whether they made 20K or 200K.  </p>

              <p>Users didn't really understand how income affected the price of their health insurance. They had a slight idea, but didn't understand that a few thousand dollar discrepency could make their health insurance cost a couple hundred dollar less each month.</p>
              <!--<p>We found an interesting behavior when going through Mixpanel - some users would put in their income and view their plan price, come back and adjust their income slightly and view a new plan price. And they would keep looping back and forth varying their income ever so slightly. This made our onboarding take a hit, so we wanted to reduce this behavior.</p>-->

              <p>In qualitative user research, it's really hard to tease our an exact, well defined problem. Users often don't know what they want, and might not always articulate it. Low fidelity prototypes allowed me to put concepts in front of users that they could react to. This phase helped me narrow down solutions, but it also helped me tease out each problem further. </p>

                <h4>How it works</h4>
                <p>In the beginning, I  tried using copy to explain the relationship between income and plan prices. But most users never read it. So I designed little feedback loops on the income entry screen that would autocalculate users' subsidy and the their plan price. </p>
                <p>This solution aimed to visually and directly demonstrate the link between income and health insurance prices. </p>

              <p>Here are the results from the launch of this project.</p>

              <div class="row">
                <p>Feature 1 helped users estimate their income by breaking it down by job. This feature actually decreased onboarding conversion by 10%. When I conducted usability tests post implementation, users cited that they didn't really care about accuracy at this stage. They were often just shopping around, and while they needed help <i>estimating</i>, they didn't care about <i>accuracy.</i> </p>
                <p>We as a business got too excited about <i>income accuracy</i>, but our users did not. We over designed for a feature we care about, and strayed away from user needs. </p>
                <p>The goal of this project was also to help more users get subsidies, but we got distracted by tyring to make income more accurate. </p>

              </div>
              <div class="row">
                <p>Feature 2 provided users an anchor point/threshold income before users checked for subsidy qualification. This feature was a rousing success! We went from 30% total subsidy-eligible users to total 45% subsidy eligible users. </p>
                <p>Our onboarding conversion did not take a hit as a result of this feature.</p>
                <p>This also had positive effects downstream. Our E2E conversion increased by 33% as subsidy eligible users were much more likely to convert than ineligible users. </p>

                <h5 class="title-quote">Feedback Loops</h5>
                <p>Feature 3 provided instant subsidy calculation as a user was typing in their income. It reduced the looping behavior we observed in some users.</p>

              </div>
              <div class="row">
                <p>It also had downstream effects, where users were less likely to change their income later on, after they picked a plan and were filling out their plan application. </p>

            <h3>Insights and Recommendations</h3>
            <p>This project was one of the biggest and most successful to bring about a step change to conversion rates at Stride.</p>
            <p>While the Guided Income feature was not as successful as we had hoped, it taught us to not get too sidetracked by what management wanted, and to keep the focus on grounded user needs. </p>
            <p>Guided Income was overkill for a health insurance onboarding. The research done on the feature also laid out the foundation for what is our new product, Stride Finance.  </p>
