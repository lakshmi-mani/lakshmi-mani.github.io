          <div class="row">
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Over the past two years, my trips to Hong Kong have increased quite a bit. Usually I go down for a weekend to visit Le Boyfriend. I didn’t buy a mobile or 3g plan, considering how short my trips were. So without El Boyfriend around sometimes, I would have no mobile or 3G plan, in a country where I didn’t speak the language: Essentially screwed during emergencies. </p>
            <p>This kinda coincided with a cycling accident, where all I wanted to do was get to a hospital as soon as possible: but I had to sit around checking my Google Maps for clinics, which never gave me all the results. After narrowing down the closest clinics, I had to manually check the opening hours and telephone number, give them a call and figuring out if they were open. All this happened while bleeding.</p>
        </div>

          <div class="row">
            <h2>The Idea</h2>
            <p>So we kinda had this idea of working on an app that would help me (and other tourists as well) that would store data about emergency locations within your phone, so you never had to worry about an internet connection. </p>
            <p>Also, it would show you the nearest locations based on where you are, so essentially, you can open an app, and boom you know where to go in cases of emergency. </p>
        </div>

          <div class="row">
            <h2>The Design Process</h2>
            <p>The first part was getting the data about emergency locations. Luckily for us, the HK government had recently began an OpenData scheme to encourage more applications to be developed. So all we have to do was generate the list of locations, and just store that within the app itself. Voila!</p>
            <p>This was an app we were hoping people would never have to use, only in cases of emergency. And we wanted all information to be available instantly. So there should not be a need to download information. We also wanted to reduce users decision making as much as we possible could.</p>
            <p>So the initial idea for icons, that people would click, which would give results got scraped. That was an additional layer to the decision process that could be skipped.</p>
            <img src="sketch.jpg" />
        </div>

          <div class="row">
            <p>Next we needed some way to showcase different options that people could choose within each category. So if someone needed a hospital, they could choose between the first, second et etc options. Initially we came up with the idea of using arrows to signal the ability to navigate between different options. But soon we scraped that as it occupied screen space within each card, and served as a distraction. </p>
            <div class="col-sm-4"><img src="arrows1.jpg" /></div>
            <div class="col-sm-4"><img src="arrows2.jpg" /></div>
            <div class="col-sm-4"><img src="arrows3.jpg" /></div>
        </div>

          <div class="row">
            <p>[USER CONFUSION GOES HERE] So we then thought of using cards that were peeking out on both sides to signal scrolling. This was a intuitive way of suggesting the ability to view multiple locations within each category.</p>
           <div class="col-sm-6"><img src="cards1.jpg" /></div>
           <div class="col-sm-6"><img src="cards2.png" /></div>
        </div>

          <div class="row">
            <p>In our effort to completely rid of all decision making, we tried to provide all information about each place in one shot. So each location card would contain all information so everything was available without any button presses. However, what happened was, there was an overwhelming amount information presented to the user. Users were at an early stage of decision making (narrowing down to their top 1 or 2 choices). Presenting them with information that they did not need at this stage. They only needed the nitty gritty details once their decisions had been made, ie the ability to drill down for more information of maybe their top two choices.</p>
            <div class="col-sm-offset-3 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-right-3"><img src="fulldisplay.jpg" /></div>
        </div>

          <div class="row">
            <p>So what we did was, once you clicked on each card, it would provide you more detailed information about each location. So this would be key info like addresses, opening hours, a directions option that led you to google maps, and finally a translation option. </p>
            <div class="col-sm-offset-3 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-right-3"><img src="opened.png" /></div>
          </div>

          <div class="row">
            <p>We got this idea from a recent trip to thailand. We took a picture of the Thai signage for Toilet. So each time we needed to say where we wanted to go, we would just whip out that picture, rather than trying to mime the urgent need to pee. That picture essentially eliminated any language barrier we had. And we wanted to bring that to the app as well. </p>
            <p>So in a non-english speaking country, it would be hard to get your directions across. And the last thing you would want would be to stall, and wait around or head to the wrong place. So we wanted to bring that essence of avoiding the language barrier. So when getting a taxi, or asking people, all the location details would be shown in Chinese. This makes life simpler?</p>
